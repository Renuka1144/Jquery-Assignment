             jQuery is a small, fast and lightweight JavaScript library.
             jQuery is platform-independent.     
             jQuery means "write less do more".     
             jQuery simplifies AJAX call and DOM manipulation.


Q.2: How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in Jquery , JQuery Animation?

Ans:           
      Applying CSS Using jQuery

You can use jQuery to apply CSS styles to HTML elements. There are a few ways to achieve this:

1.   Using  css()  Method  :
   The  css()  method in jQuery allows you to get or set CSS properties for selected elements.

      javascript
       Set CSS properties
   $('#myElement').css('color', 'red');
   $('#myElement').css({
       'font-size': '20px',
       'background-color': 'yellow'
   });

       Get CSS property
   var fontSize = $('#myElement').css('font-size');
      

2.   Adding a CSS Class  :
   Instead of directly setting styles, it's often cleaner to add or remove classes, especially for complex styling.

      Adding Class and Removing Class in jQuery

1.   Adding a Class  :
   You can use the  addClass()  method to add a class to selected elements.

      javascript
   $('#myElement').addClass('highlight');
      

2.   Removing a Class  :
   Similarly, use  removeClass()  method to remove a class from selected elements.

      javascript
   $('#myElement').removeClass('highlight');
      

      jQuery Animation

jQuery provides easy-to-use methods for animations, allowing you to create effects like fading, sliding, and more.

1.   Basic Animation  :
   You can use the  animate()  method to perform custom animations on selected elements.

      javascript
   $('#myElement').animate({
       opacity: 0.5,
       left: '+=50',
       height: 'toggle'
   }, 1000, function() {
           Animation complete
   });
      

   Here:
   -  opacity: 0.5  makes the element half transparent.
   -  left: '+=50'  moves the element 50 pixels to the right.
   -  height: 'toggle'  toggles the height (either hides or shows the element).

2.   Fading and Sliding Effects  :
   jQuery provides methods like  fadeIn() ,  fadeOut() ,  slideDown() ,  slideUp() , etc., for common animation effects.

      javascript
   $('#myElement').fadeIn(1000);     Fade in over 1 second
   $('#myElement').slideUp(500);     Slide up over 0.5 seconds
      

Remember to include jQuery in your HTML file before using these scripts:

   html
<script src="https:   code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
   

Ensure that all jQuery code is executed after the DOM has fully loaded:

   javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
        Your jQuery code here
});
   

These examples should get you started with applying CSS, adding/removing classes, and using animations with jQuery.
 Feel free to adapt them based on your specific needs.
